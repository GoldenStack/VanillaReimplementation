/**
 * A fast, all-purpose, rock-solid, small-state {@linkplain Random pseudorandom number generator}.
 * It has excellent speed, but its state space (128 bits) that is large enough for mild parallelism
 * only; it passes all tests we are aware of.
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that starting with Java 17 you can find this generator in <a href=
 * "https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/random/package-summary.html"><code>java.util.random</code></a>.
 *
 * <p>
 * By using the supplied {@link #jump()} method it is possible to generate non-overlapping long
 * sequences for parallel computations; {@link #longJump()} makes it possible to create several
 * starting points, each providing several non-overlapping sequences, for distributed computations.
 * This class provides also a {@link #split()} method to support recursive parallel computations, in
 * the spirit of {@link SplittableRandom}.
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Warning</strong>: before release 2.6.3, the {@link #split()} method would not alter the
 * state of the caller, and it would return instances initialized in the same way if called multiple
 * times. This was a major mistake in the implementation and it has been fixed, but as a consequence
 * the output of the caller after a call to {@link #split()} is now different, and the result of
 * {@link #split()} is initialized in a different way.
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that this is not a {@linkplain SecureRandom secure generator}.
